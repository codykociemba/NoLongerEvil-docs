</Warning>

## Endpoint

```

## Authentication

**Required Scopes**: `write`

**Additional Requirement**: Must be the device owner (not just shared access)

## Request

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `deviceId` | string | Yes | Device ID to delete |

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer nle_your_api_key_here` | Yes |

### Example Request

```
DELETE /api/v1/thermostat/dev_abc123xyz
Authorization: Bearer nle_your_api_key_here
```

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Device deleted successfully"
}
```

### Error Responses

#### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "Only device owners can delete devices"
}
```

**Cause**: You have shared access to this device but are not the owner.

**Solution**: Only the device owner can delete it. If you want to remove your access, ask the owner to revoke the share.

#### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "Device not found"
}
```

**Cause**: Device ID doesn't exist or you don't have access to it.

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://nolongerevil.com/api/v1/thermostat/${deviceId}`,
    {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer nle_your_api_key_here'

## What Happens After Deletion

When you delete a device:

1. **Device is unlinked** from your account
2. **All shares are revoked** - users with shared access lose access
3. **Device settings persist** - temperature, schedule, etc. remain on the device
4. **Device remains functional** - continues operating with last known settings
5. **Can be reclaimed** - Generate a new entry key on the thermostat to reclaim it

## Use Cases

### Device Replacement

```javascript
// When replacing an old thermostat
async function replaceDevice(oldDeviceId, newEntryKey) {
  // Delete old device
  await deleteDevice(oldDeviceId);

  // Claim new device
  await claimDevice(newEntryKey);
}
```

### Selling/Moving

```javascript
// When selling your home or moving out
async function removeAllDevices() {
  const { devices } = await listDevices();

  for (const device of devices) {
    if (device.accessType === 'owner') {
      await deleteDevice(device.id);
      console.log(`Deleted ${device.name || device.serial}`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Reclaiming a Deleted Device

To reclaim a device after deletion:

1. On the thermostat: Settings → Nest App → Get Entry Code
2. In dashboard: Add Device → Enter the entry code
3. Device will be linked to your account again

<Tip>
  Before deleting a device, consider if you just want to transfer ownership instead. Contact support for ownership transfer assistance.
