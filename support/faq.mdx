## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this legal?" icon="gavel">
    **Yes.** You own your thermostat and have the right to modify its software under right-to-repair principles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will this void my warranty?" icon="file-contract">
    **Possibly.** Flashing custom firmware may void Google/Nest's warranty.

    However, if your device is out of warranty or Google has discontinued support, this doesn't matter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I go back to Google's servers?" icon="rotate-left">
    **Yes.** You can reflash the original Nest firmware to restore factory functionality.

    Note: We don't provide Google's firmware. You'd need to obtain it separately or contact Nest support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with Nest Gen 1 or Gen 3?" icon="question">
    **Not yet.** Currently only **Generation 2** is supported.

    Gen 1 and Gen 3 support is under development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AffeGaJ5XS) for updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?" icon="shield-check">
    **Yes.** All communication uses SSL/TLS encryption.

    For the hosted service, we don't sell or share your data.

    For complete data ownership, consider [self-hosting](/self-hosted/overview).

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if No Longer Evil shuts down?" icon="power-off">
    **Hosted service users**: Your thermostat will lose remote access but continue working locally.

    **Self-hosted users**: No impact - you're completely independent.

    We're committed to open-sourcing everything so the community can continue the project indefinitely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this without internet?" icon="wifi-slash">
    **With self-hosting**: Yes! Run the API server on your local network and your thermostat works without internet.

    **With hosted service**: No. The thermostat needs internet to reach No Longer Evil servers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens during flashing if something goes wrong?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Worst case**: Device might be bricked (unresponsive).

    **Recovery options**:
    - Try reflashing (often works)
    - Contact community for help

    **Prevention**: Ensure battery is charged, use good USB cable, don't disconnect during flashing.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My thermostat shows offline in the dashboard" icon="plug-circle-xmark">
    **Check**:
    1. Device is connected to WiFi (Settings → Network)
    2. Internet connection is working
    3. Firewall isn't blocking port 443
    4. Try different network (phone hotspot) to isolate issue

  <Accordion title="Entry code doesn't work" icon="key">
    **Common causes**:
    - Code expired (>1 hour old) - generate new one
    - Typo (check 0/O, 1/I/L confusion)
    - Code already used - generate new one
    - Device not online - check WiFi

    See [Entry Code Troubleshooting](/hosted/troubleshooting#entry-code-issues)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't enter DFU mode" icon="usb">
    **Try**:
    - Charge battery to >50%
    - Use different USB cable (data-capable, not charge-only)
    - Hold display for full 15 seconds
    - Start installer BEFORE rebooting device
