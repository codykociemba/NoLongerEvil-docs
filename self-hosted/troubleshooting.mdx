## Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Docker containers won't start" icon="docker">
    **Symptoms**: `docker ps` shows no running containers

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check Docker is running**:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl status docker  # Linux
       # or check Docker Desktop is running on macOS
       ```

    2. **View container logs**:
       ```bash
       docker logs <container-name>
       ```

    3. **Check for port conflicts**:
       ```bash
       sudo lsof -i :443  # Check if port 443 is in use
       sudo lsof -i :8081 # Check if port 8081 is in use
       ```

    4. **Restart Docker**:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart docker  # Linux
       # or restart Docker Desktop on macOS
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build dependencies failed to install" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --fix-missing build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev gcc pkg-config
    ```

    **macOS**:
    ```bash
    # Make sure Homebrew is up to date
    brew update
    brew doctor
    brew install libusb pkg-config
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="install.sh: Permission denied" icon="lock">
    **Solution**: Make the script executable
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Thermostat Flashing Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Device won't enter DFU mode (Gen 2)" icon="usb">
    **Try these steps in order**:
    1. **Boot device on backplate first** - Connect to wall mount and let it fully boot to home screen
    2. **Remove from wall** - Once booted, remove from backplate
    3. **Connect USB** - Use data-capable cable (not charge-only)
    4. **Charge battery** - Ensure >50% battery
    5. **Reboot** - Hold display for 10-15 seconds

    See [DFU Mode Troubleshooting](/hosted/troubleshooting#dfu-mode-issues) for more details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gen 1 contact bridging not working" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    **Common issues**:
    - Contacts not held long enough - Keep bridging until USB connects
    - Wrong contacts bridged - Double-check the image in the guide
    - Battery disconnected - Device won't boot without battery
    - Screen still on - Make sure screen is off before bridging

    **Solution**: Try multiple times, ensuring:
    - Battery is connected
    - Screen is off
    - Installer is waiting
    - Bridge contacts, THEN connect USB while holding bridge
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Installer doesn't detect device" icon="computer">
    **Linux**:
    1. **Check USB permissions**:
       ```bash
       sudo ./install.sh
       ```

    2. **Add udev rules**:
       ```bash
       echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0451", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-omap.rules
       sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
       ```

    **macOS**:
    - Grant USB permissions in System Preferences → Security & Privacy

    **Both**:
    - Try different USB cable (must be data-capable)
    - Try different USB port
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Server Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Thermostat can't connect to server" icon="plug-circle-xmark">
    **Check**:
    1. **API server is running**:
       ```bash
       docker ps | grep api
       curl http://localhost:443  # Should respond
       ```

    2. **Firewall allows connections**:
       ```bash
       sudo ufw allow 443  # Linux
       sudo ufw allow 8081
       ```

    3. **Port forwarding configured** (if remote access):
       - Check router settings
       - Verify ports 443 and 8081 are forwarded to your server

    4. **DNS resolves correctly** (if using domain):
       ```bash
       nslookup your-domain.com
       ```

    5. **Thermostat can reach server**:
       - Check WiFi connection on thermostat
       - Verify thermostat is on same network (for local-only setup)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL/TLS certificate errors" icon="shield-xmark">
    **Self-signed certificates**:
    If using self-signed certs, browsers will warn. You can:
    - Use Let's Encrypt for free valid certificates
    - Accept the browser warning (not recommended for production)

    **Let's Encrypt setup**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install certbot
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
    ```

    Then configure your server to use the certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Docker Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Containers keep restarting" icon="rotate">
    **View logs to see why**:
    ```bash
    docker logs <container-name>
    ```

    **Common causes**:
    - Port already in use
    - Missing environment variables
    - Insufficient resources (RAM/CPU)
    - Database connection failed

    **Check resource usage**:
    ```bash
    docker stats
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't access containers from host" icon="network-wired">
    **Check port mappings**:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    Look for `0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp` and `0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp`

    **If ports aren't mapped**, recreate containers with proper port mapping:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 443:443 -p 8081:8081 ...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Out of disk space" icon="hard-drive">
    **Check Docker disk usage**:
    ```bash
    docker system df
    ```

    **Clean up unused resources**:
    ```bash
    docker system prune -a
    docker volume prune
    ```

    **Warning**: This will remove all stopped containers and unused images
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Network & Remote Access

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't access server remotely" icon="globe">
    **Check these in order**:

    1. **Port forwarding configured**:
       - Log into your router
       - Forward ports 443, 8081 to your server's local IP
       - Verify forwards are active

    2. **Firewall allows traffic**:
       ```bash
       sudo ufw status
       sudo ufw allow 443
       sudo ufw allow 8081
       ```

    3. **Public IP correct**:
       ```bash
       curl ifconfig.me  # Shows your public IP
       ```

    4. **Dynamic DNS working** (if using DDNS):
       - Verify DNS record points to current IP
       - Check DDNS client is running and updating

    5. **ISP not blocking ports**:
       - Some ISPs block port 443/80
       - Try alternative ports or contact ISP
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTTPS not working" icon="lock">
    **Check certificate**:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot certificates
    ```

    **Renew if expired**:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew
    ```

    **Test HTTPS endpoint**:
    ```bash
    curl -k https://your-domain.com  # -k skips cert validation
    ```

    **Common issues**:
    - Certificate not installed correctly
    - Server not configured for HTTPS
    - Port 443 not open
    - Domain doesn't match certificate
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server running slow" icon="gauge-high">
    **Check resource usage**:
    ```bash
    top
    docker stats
    df -h  # Check disk space
    ```

    **Solutions**:
    - Allocate more resources to Docker
    - Optimize database queries
    - Reduce logging verbosity
    - Use faster storage (SSD vs HDD)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High memory usage" icon="memory">
    **Check which container is using memory**:
    ```bash
    docker stats
    ```

    **Limit container memory**:
    ```bash
    docker update --memory="512m" <container-id>
    ```

    **Restart containers to free memory**:
    ```bash
    docker restart $(docker ps -q)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
