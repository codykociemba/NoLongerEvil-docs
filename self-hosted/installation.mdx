description: 'Complete guide to setting up your own No Longer Evil infrastructure'
---

<Warning>
  **Work in Progress**: The self-hosted installation is currently a work in progress and may or may not function correctly. For a stable, production-ready experience, we recommend using the [hosted service](/hosted/overview) instead.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Before you begin:**

  - Ensure you have a **Nest Generation 1 or Generation 2** thermostat ([check compatibility](/compatibility))
  - This is for **advanced users** comfortable with command line, Docker, and networking
  - You'll need a **server that can run 24/7** (Raspberry Pi, NAS, VPS, etc.)
  - **Gen 1 requires device teardown** - only proceed if comfortable with electronics disassembly
</Warning>

## Overview

The self-hosted installation sets up:
1. **Firmware flashing tools** - To flash your Nest thermostat
2. **API Server** - Backend server for thermostat communication (runs in Docker container)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the `open-source-prototype` branch:

```bash
git clone -b open-source-prototype https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat.git
cd NoLongerEvil-Thermostat
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev gcc pkg-config docker.io nodejs npm
    ```

    **Start Docker:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    ```

    **Add your user to docker group** (optional, to run docker without sudo):
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    Log out and log back in for this to take effect.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="macOS">
    First, install Homebrew if you don't have it:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    Then install dependencies:
    ```bash
    brew install libusb pkg-config docker nodejs
    ```

    <Note>
      **Docker Desktop for Mac**: You'll also need to install Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Make sure it's running before proceeding.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Run the Installer

The installer will:
- Build firmware flashing tools
- Set up Docker container for the API server
- Guide you through flashing your thermostat

Run the installer:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

<Note>
  The installer is interactive and will prompt you for configuration options. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully.
</Note>

---

## Step 4: Flash Your Thermostat

The installer will guide you through flashing your thermostat. **The process differs for Gen 1 and Gen 2 - choose your device below:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generation 2 (Easy)">
    ### Gen 2: Simple USB Method

    Follow these steps carefully:

    1. **Boot device on backplate** - Connect your Nest to the wall backplate and let it fully boot to the home screen
    2. **Remove from wall** - Once fully booted, remove the Nest from its backplate
    3. **Connect via USB** - Plug the Nest into your computer using a micro USB cable
    4. **Reboot the device** - Press and hold down on the display for 10-15 seconds until the device reboots
    5. **DFU mode active** - The installer will detect the device and begin flashing

    The firmware installer will automatically flash the custom bootloader (x-load, u-boot) and kernel (uImage).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Generation 1 (Advanced)">
    ### Gen 1: Teardown & Contact Bridge Method

    <Warning>
      **Gen 1 requires physical disassembly.** This process involves opening the device and manually bridging internal contacts. Only proceed if you're comfortable with electronics teardown.

      **Credit:** Gen 1 DFU mode instructions adapted from [guyman70718's cuckoo_loader_gen1 guide](https://github.com/guyman70718/cuckoo_loader_gen1).
    </Warning>

    #### Tools Needed:
    - Phillips screwdriver or prying tool
    - Metal tweezers or similar conductive object
    - Mini USB cable
    - Non-conductive object for battery removal

    #### Teardown Steps:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Begin Disassembly">
        Follow the [SparkFun Nest Thermostat Teardown Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nest-thermostat-teardown-/all) to open your Gen 1 thermostat.

        You need to access the internal circuit board.

          <img src="/public/nest-gen1-teardown-step1.jpg" alt="Gen 1 Nest internal components exposed" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Disconnect Battery">
        Unplug the battery by inserting your finger or a **NON-CONDUCTIVE object** underneath the battery wires. It lifts directly up.

        **Important:** Do not use metal tools for this step.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Remove Metal Shield">
        Detach the metal shield from the corner to expose the circuit board components and contact points.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/public/nest-gen1-teardown-step2.png" alt="Metal shield removal" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Reconnect Battery">
        Reconnect the battery while keeping the shield removed.

        **Note:** The device will not boot without a battery connected.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Prepare for DFU Mode">
        Ensure:
        - Battery is reconnected
        - Screen is off
        - The installer is waiting for the device
        - Mini USB cable is ready but not yet connected
      </Step>

      <Step title="Bridge Contacts & Connect USB">
        Using metal tweezers or a conductive tool, **bridge the black and yellow resistor contacts** shown in the image below:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/public/nest-gen1-teardown-step3.png" alt="Contact bridging points for DFU mode" />
        </Frame>

        While holding the contacts bridged, connect the mini USB cable to the device.

        The thermostat should boot into DFU mode and the installer will detect it.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait for Flash">
        Once detected, the installer will automatically flash the custom bootloader and kernel.

        Keep the device connected and don't disconnect until flashing completes.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>
      **After successful flashing**, you can reassemble your Gen 1 thermostat by reversing the teardown steps. The device should boot normally with the new firmware.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Step 5: Build the server

After you have completed flashing your device, you can build the API server. Run the commands below to build.

```bash
cd server
npm run build
docker build -t nolongerevil .
```

---

## Step 6: Starting the API Server

After the build completes, you can start the API Server. Copy the `docker-compose.yml.example` to your own `docker-compose.yml` file. 

```bash
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
```

You then need to edit the environment settings in this new file for your setup.

<Note>
  If you want to use Home Assistant/MQTT, follow **Step 6** below before starting the server.
</Note>

Once done, you can start the server with the below command.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Check Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see a container image `nolongerevil` running.  

### Test API Server

The default `docker-compose` will expose the API Server on port you selected in your `docker-compose.yml` file.  
You can confirm connectivity with `curl`.

```bash
curl localhost:80
```

---

## Step 6: Home Assistant/MQTT Integration (Optional)

If you use Home Assistant, you can integrate No Longer Evil using MQTT for automatic device discovery.

### Configure MQTT Integration

Update the following environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **NEST_DEVICES:**
This should be the IP address of your Nest thermostat and the device ID. Should be separated with a `:`.
(If you have more than one device, separate them with a `,`.)
```yml
- NEST_DEVICES=192.168.1.20:ABCDEFGHIJKMNOPQ
```
- **MQTT_ENABLED:**
`true` to enable, or `false` to disable.
```yml
- MQTT_ENABLED=true
```
- **MQTT_SERVER_IP:**
The IP address of your MQTT server.
```yml
- MQTT_SERVER_IP=192.168.1.19
```
- **MQTT_SERVER_PORT:**
The port your MQTT server is listening on.
```yml
- MQTT_SERVER_PORT=1883
```
- **MQTT_USERNAME/MQTT_PASSWORD:**
If secure, you can input your MQTT credentials.
```yml
- MQTT_USERNAME=
- MQTT_PASSWORD=
```
- **Other MQTT Settings:**
While not recommended, you can edit the default values for the below environment settings.
```yml
- MQTT_CLIENT_ID=nolongerevil-hass
- MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX=nest
- MQTT_DISCOVERY_PREFIX=homeassistant
```
- **MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY:**
Use this to make the device Home Assistant discoverable. `true` to enable, or `false` to disable.
```yml
- MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY=false
```
Once you start the server after modifying `NEST_DEVICES` and/or `MQTT_*` settings, the 
server will attempt to initialize your device. You will see in the docker logs where the
server will try and update the endpoint of your device to the environment setting
`API_ORIGIN`. Your Nest device must be active (screen on) when this runs for the first time.
Subsequent start up will check the local SQLite database to see if the device already exists. 

**Requirements:**
- Home Assistant must have MQTT broker configured (Mosquitto addon recommended)
- MQTT broker must be accessible from your No Longer Evil server
- If using authentication, create a dedicated MQTT user in Home Assistant

<Note>
  Once configured, your Nest thermostats will automatically appear in Home Assistant under MQTT devices with the entity `climate.nest_DEVICE_ID`. They will support climate control, temperature monitoring, and scheduling through Home Assistant.
</Note>

---

## Step 8: Configure Networking (For Remote Access)

If you want to access your thermostat remotely (outside your local network):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Port Forwarding">
    Configure your router to forward these ports to your server:
    - **Port 443** - Thermostat Communication API (HTTPS)
    - **Port 8081** - Control API (HTTP)
    - **Port 5173** (or 80/443 if using nginx) - Frontend (if self-hosting)
  </Step>

  <Step title="DNS/DDNS Setup">
    Set up a domain name or Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service to point to your public IP:
    - Use a service like DuckDNS, No-IP, or your own domain
    - Configure it to update automatically if your IP changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="SSL/TLS Certificates">
    For secure HTTPS access, set up SSL certificates:
    - Use Let's Encrypt with certbot
    - Or use a reverse proxy like nginx with automatic certificate management

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install certbot
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
