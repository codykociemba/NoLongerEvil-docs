title: Self-Hosted Overview
description: 'Run your own No Longer Evil infrastructure for complete control'
---

<Warning>
  **Work in Progress**: The self-hosted installation is currently a work in progress and may or may not function correctly. For a stable, production-ready experience, we recommend using the [hosted service](/hosted/overview) instead.
</Warning>

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means running your own No Longer Evil infrastructure on your own server. Your thermostat connects to **your server**, not the hosted service at nolongerevil.com.

<Warning>
  **Advanced Users Only**: Self-hosting requires technical troubleshooting skills with command line, Docker, and networking. If you're not comfortable with these, we recommend using the [hosted service](/hosted/overview) instead.
</Warning>

## How It Works

Self-hosting No Longer Evil involves running your own infrastructure stack instead of relying on the hosted service:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Installer">
    Clone the repository and run `install.sh`, which sets up firmware flashing tools and guides you through server configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flash Your Thermostat">
    Use the firmware flashing tools to flash custom firmware to your Nest Gen 1 or Gen 2 thermostat via USB. The firmware redirects all traffic from Google servers to **your server**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start your Docker container">
    Using the `open-soure-prototype` branch, copy the `docker-compose.yml.example` to `docker-compose.yml` and modify for your environment. Then start the server container.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thermostat Connects to Your Server">
    Once flashed, your thermostat connects to your self-hosted API server instead of Google's servers. All communication stays within your infrastructure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Control Your Thermostat">
    Access your thermostat through your Home Assistant (via MQTT), or directly through the API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Key Difference from Hosted**: You're responsible for running the API server. The hosted service runs this and a frontend for you.

## Self-Hosted vs Hosted Service

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Choose Self-Hosted" icon="server">
    **Choose self-hosting if you:**
    - Want complete data ownership and privacy
    - Need the system to run independently of any external service
    - Want to customize or extend the functionality
    - Are comfortable with server administration and troubleshooting
    - Want to learn how the system works internally
    - Need local-only network operation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When to Choose Hosted Service" icon="cloud">
    **Choose the hosted service if you:**
    - Want a plug-and-play solution with no server setup
    - Don't want to manage infrastructure and updates
    - Need something that "just works" with minimal maintenance
    - Don't have 24/7 server hardware available
    - Are not comfortable with command line and networking
    - Want automatic updates and improvements
