title: Self-Hosted Overview
description: 'Run your own NoLongerEvil infrastructure for complete control'
---

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means running the entire NoLongerEvil stack on your own infrastructure rather than using our managed service. Your thermostat connects to **your server**, giving you complete control over data and functionality.

<Warning>
  **Advanced users only!** Self-hosting requires:
  - Server administration experience
  - Comfort with command line/terminal
  - Understanding of networking, Docker, and databases
  - Time for setup and ongoing maintenance

  If this sounds overwhelming, we recommend the [hosted service](/hosted/overview).
</Warning>

## Architecture Overview

When self-hosting, you'll run these components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Server (Port 443)">
    Node.js HTTPS server that intercepts thermostat communication

    **Responsibilities**:
    - Handle device connections and authentication
    - Proxy weather requests
    - Manage device state synchronization
    - Generate entry keys

    **Requirements**:
    - Public IP or DDNS
    - SSL/TLS certificate
    - Port 443 accessible
  </Step>

  <Step title="Control API (Port 8081)">
    HTTP API for sending commands and querying device status

    **Responsibilities**:
    - Accept control commands (temperature, mode)
    - Provide device status
    - List connected devices

    **Requirements**:
    - Port 8081 accessible (can be localhost-only)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database (Convex)">
    Backend database for persistent storage

    **Stores**:
    - Device state and configuration
    - User accounts (if using frontend)
    - Entry keys
    - Weather cache

    **Options**:
    - Convex Cloud (easiest)
    - Self-hosted Convex (advanced)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Frontend (Optional)">
    Next.js web application for device management

    **Features**:
    - User authentication (Clerk)
    - Device dashboard
    - Control interface

    **Note**: You can use the hosted frontend at nolongerevil.com pointed at your self-hosted API
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Options

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Home Server" icon="house-signal">
    Raspberry Pi, NAS, or dedicated machine

    **Pros**: Complete control, no recurring costs

    **Cons**: Requires port forwarding, dynamic IP management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cloud VPS" icon="cloud">
    DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.

    **Pros**: Static IP, reliable uptime, easy SSL

    **Cons**: Monthly cost ($5-20/mo)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docker Homelab" icon="docker">
    Existing Docker/Portainer setup

    **Pros**: Integrates with existing infrastructure

    **Cons**: Need existing knowledge

- **Troubleshooting**: 1-2 hours (varies)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: ~1 hour/month

## Setup Process Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Install Docker, set up domain, configure firewall

    [View detailed prerequisites →](/self-hosted/prerequisites)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Infrastructure Setup">
    Create Convex database, configure SSL certificates, set up environment variables

    [View infrastructure guide →](/self-hosted/infrastructure-setup)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Custom Firmware">
    Compile firmware with your API URL instead of NoLongerEvil's

    [View firmware building guide →](/self-hosted/building-firmware)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run API Server">
    Deploy the Docker containers for API server and control API

    [View API server guide →](/self-hosted/running-api-server)
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Deploy Frontend">
    Host your own web dashboard or use hybrid approach

    [View configuration reference →](/self-hosted/configuration-reference)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Flash Firmware">
    Use the same flashing process as hosted, but with your custom-built firmware

    [Back to installation guide →](/hosted/installation)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Beginners)

You don't have to self-host everything:

<Accordion title="Option 1: Self-Hosted API + Hosted Frontend">
  **What you run**: API server only

  **What NoLongerEvil provides**: Web dashboard

  **How it works**:
  - Your thermostat connects to your API server
  - You configure the hosted frontend to point to your API URL
  - You control your data while using our interface

  **Pros**:
  - Easiest self-hosted option
  - Data ownership
  - No frontend maintenance

  **Cons**:
  - Depend on our frontend availability
  - Must expose API publicly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2: Full Self-Hosted">
  **What you run**: API server + frontend + database

  **What NoLongerEvil provides**: Nothing (fully independent)

  **Pros**:
  - Complete independence
  - Full customization
  - No external dependencies

  **Cons**:
  - Most complex setup
  - Frontend maintenance required
  - Authentication setup needed
</Accordion>

## Costs

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  - Port forwarding and firewall configuration
  - DNS and domain management
  - Database connection problems
  - Environment variable configuration errors

  **If you're not comfortable with these topics**, we strongly recommend starting with the [hosted service](/hosted/overview).
</Warning>

## Support for Self-Hosting

<Info>
  While we provide documentation and community support for self-hosting, **we cannot provide 1-on-1 support for custom infrastructure issues**.

  The community Discord and GitHub Issues are your best resources.
