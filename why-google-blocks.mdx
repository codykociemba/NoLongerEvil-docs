## The Problem

Google/Nest is intentionally blocking older Generation 1 and Generation 2 thermostats from accessing their API servers, even though these devices are **fully functional and use the exact same API structure as newer models**.

## How the Blocking Works

Google's blocking mechanism is surprisingly simple and arbitrary. When a Nest device connects to their API, it sends a model identifier (e.g., `Display-2.8` for Gen 2, `Display-3.7` for Gen 3). Based solely on this identifier, Google's servers return different responses:

### Gen 1 & Gen 2 Response (Blocked)

```json
{
    "czfe_url": "",
    "server_version": "9.45.0.63171-20251016-edb6514",
    "ping_url": "",
    "passphrase_url": "",
    "pro_info_url": "",
    "transport_url": "",
    "tier_name": "production",
    "weather_url": "https://weather.nest.com/weather/v1?query=",
    "upload_url": "https://logsink.devices.nest.com/upload",
    "direct_transport_url": ""
}
```

Notice how all the critical URLs (`czfe_url`, `ping_url`, `passphrase_url`, `transport_url`) are **empty strings**. Without these URLs, the thermostat cannot communicate with the API to function properly.

### Gen 3 Response (Working)

```json
{
    "czfe_url": "https://czfe14-front01-iad01.transport.home.nest.com:9543",
    "server_version": "9.45.0.63171-20251016-edb6514",
    "ping_url": "https://czfe14-front01-iad01.transport.home.nest.com:9543",
    "passphrase_url": "https://squeakydoor.nest.com/device/passphrase",
    "pro_info_url": "https://squeakydoor.nest.com/pro-info",
    "transport_url": "https://czfe14-front01-iad01.transport.home.nest.com:9543",
    "tier_name": "production",
    "weather_url": "https://weather.nest.com/weather/v1?query=",
    "upload_url": "https://logsink.devices.nest.com/upload",
    "direct_transport_url": "https://czfe14-front01-iad01.transport.home.nest.com:9543"
}
```

When the model is changed from `Display-2.8` to `Display-3.7`, **all the URLs magically appear**. The API structure is identical, the protocol is the same, and the hardware is capable - Google is simply blocking older devices by checking the model string.

## Key Findings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Identical API Structure" icon="code">
    Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3 devices use the **exact same API endpoints and protocol**. There are no technical differences in how they communicate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Arbitrary Blocking" icon="ban">
    Google blocks devices based **solely on the model identifier**, not on any actual technical limitation or incompatibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Telemetry Still Works" icon="upload">
    Interestingly, the `upload_url` for logging is **still provided** to blocked devices. Google continues collecting telemetry data from Gen 1 & Gen 2 devices even while blocking their core functionality.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Planned Obsolescence" icon="trash">
    This is a clear case of **artificial obsolescence** - perfectly functional hardware being intentionally disabled to push users toward newer products.

## Why No Longer Evil Exists

<Warning>
  This blocking behavior is why **No Longer Evil exists**. We believe you should have the right to continue using hardware you own, especially when it's fully functional and Google is blocking it through artificial software restrictions.
