## Hosted Service (Recommended)

### What You Get

The hosted service uses NoLongerEvil's managed infrastructure at **nolongerevil.com**. Your thermostat connects to our servers instead of Google's.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Zero Configuration" icon="magic-wand-sparkles">
    No server setup, no database management, no SSL certificates. Just flash the firmware and start using your thermostat.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Always Up to Date" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Automatic updates to the API server, dashboard, and features. You always get the latest improvements without lifting a finger.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Web Dashboard" icon="browser">
    Access your thermostat from anywhere via our hosted web dashboard. Control temperature, schedules, and settings from any device.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Easy Device Management" icon="list-check">
    Simple entry code system to link multiple thermostats to your account. Perfect for multi-zone setups.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Novice Friendly" icon="graduation-cap">
    No technical expertise required. If you can follow step-by-step instructions and plug in a USB cable, you can do this.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What You Need

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time Required" icon="clock">
    **15-30 minutes**

    Most of this is waiting for firmware to flash and boot
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technical Level" icon="user">
    **Beginner Friendly**

    Can follow simple instructions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Limitations

<Warning>
  **Data Privacy**: Your thermostat data (temperature settings, schedules) is stored on NoLongerEvil servers. We're committed to privacy, but if you need absolute data ownership, consider self-hosting.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Service Dependency**: Your thermostat depends on NoLongerEvil's service availability. If our servers go down (rare), you'll temporarily lose remote access. Local thermostat functionality continues to work.
</Info>

### Best For

- Homeowners who want a simple, working solution
- Users without technical/server management experience
- Anyone who wants to try No Longer Evil without commitment

## Self-Hosted (Advanced)

### What You Get

Self-hosting means running your own No Longer Evil infrastructure. Your thermostat connects to **your server**, not ours.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Complete Data Ownership" icon="database">
    All thermostat data stays on your servers. You control the database, logs, and every piece of information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ No External Dependencies" icon="link-slash">
    Your thermostat works independently of No Longe Evil's service. Even if we shut down, your setup keeps running forever.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Full Customization" icon="code">
    Modify the API server, build custom integrations, add features, or tweak behavior to your exact needs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Local Network Operation" icon="network-wired">
    Run everything on your local network for ultra-low latency and no internet dependency (optional).
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### What You Need

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time Required" icon="clock">
    **2-4 hours**

    Initial setup + troubleshooting
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technical Level" icon="user-gear">
    **Advanced**

    Comfortable with command line, Docker, networking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Requirements

<Steps>
  <Step title="Server/Computer">
    A machine that can run 24/7 (Raspberry Pi, NAS, VPS, home server, or cloud VM)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Technical Skills">
    - Command line / terminal navigation
    - Basic networking knowledge (ports, firewalls, DNS)
    - Docker experience (or willingness to learn)
    - Understanding of environment variables and configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Infrastructure">
    - Public IP or DDNS service (if accessing remotely)
    - Port forwarding capability on router (if accessing remotely)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Components You'll Run

When self-hosting, you're responsible for running and maintaining:

1. **API Server (Port 443)** - Handles thermostat communication
2. **Control API (Port 8081)** - Provides control interface
3. **Database (Convex)** - Stores device state and configuration
4. **Frontend (Optional)** - Web dashboard (can use hosted version)
5. **SSL/TLS Certificates** - For secure communication

### Challenges to Expect

<Warning>
  **This path requires technical troubleshooting.** You'll need to:

  - Debug Docker containers and networking issues
  - Manage SSL certificates and renewals
  - Configure firewalls and port forwarding
  - Set up and maintain databases
  - Handle version upgrades manually

  If you're not comfortable with these tasks, we strongly recommend the hosted service.
