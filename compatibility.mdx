## How to Identify Your Nest Thermostat

Not sure which generation you have? Use this guide to identify your Nest Thermostat model.

### Method 1: Check the Backplate

Remove your Nest from the wall mount and look at the backplate for these identifying features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Level Bubble Color" icon="droplet">
    **Yellow/Green** → Gen 1 or Gen 2 ⚠️

    **Blue** → Gen 3 ❌
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wire Connectors" icon="plug">
    **8 connectors** → Gen 1 ❌

    **8-10 connectors** → Gen 2 ✅

    **10 connectors** → Gen 3 ❌
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Method 2: Check Settings Menu

This is the most reliable method:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Press on your Nest display and navigate to **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Technical Info">
    Navigate to **Settings → Technical Info**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Display Model">
    Look for the "Display model" field. The first digit tells you the generation:

    - **1x** (e.g., 1.12) → Generation 1 ❌
    - **2x** (e.g., 2.8) → Generation 2 ✅
    - **3x** (e.g., 3.7) → Generation 3 ❌
  </Step>
</Steps>
