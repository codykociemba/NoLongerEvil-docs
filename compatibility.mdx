## How to Identify Your Nest Thermostat

Not sure which generation you have? Use this guide to identify your Nest Thermostat model.

### Visual Identification

Here's what each generation looks like:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    **Key Features:**
    - Rotating ring with metallic finish
    - 8 wire connectors on backplate
    - Yellow/Green level bubble
  </Card>
  <Card title="Generation 2" icon="2">
    **Key Features:**
    - Similar rotating ring design
    - 8-10 wire connectors on backplate

### Method 1: Check the Backplate

Remove your Nest from the wall mount and look at the backplate for these identifying features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Level Bubble Color" icon="droplet">
    **Yellow/Green** → Gen 1 or Gen 2 ✅

    **Blue** → Gen 3 ❌
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wire Connectors" icon="plug">
    **8 connectors** → Gen 1 ✅

    **8-10 connectors** → Gen 2 ✅

    **10 connectors** → Gen 3 ❌
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Method 2: Check Settings Menu

This is the most reliable method:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Press on your Nest display and navigate to **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Technical Info">
    Navigate to **Settings → Technical Info**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Display Model">
    Look for the "Display model" field. The first digit tells you the generation:

    - **1x** (e.g., 1.12) → Generation 1 ✅
    - **2x** (e.g., 2.8) → Generation 2 ✅
    - **3x** (e.g., 3.7) → Generation 3 ❌
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generation-Specific Installation Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generation 1 - Requires Teardown" icon="1">
    **Gen 1 thermostats are fully supported** but require device disassembly to enter DFU mode.

    You'll need:
    - Phillips screwdriver or similar tool
    - Metal tweezers or similar conductive object
    - Patience for careful disassembly

    Gen 1 installation involves opening the device, removing the battery, bridging specific contacts, and reconnecting while the firmware loader runs. Full teardown instructions are provided in the installation guide.

    <Warning>
      Gen 1 installation is more complex and requires physical device modification. Only proceed if you're comfortable with electronics teardown.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generation 2 - Simple USB Connection" icon="2">
    **Gen 2 thermostats are the easiest to flash** - just connect via USB and run the installer.

    You'll need:
    - Micro USB cable
    - No disassembly required

    Gen 2 is the recommended option for beginners due to its simple plug-and-play installation process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generation 3 - Not Yet Supported" icon="3">
    **Support is in development.** Generation 3 uses different hardware architecture and will require more extensive development.

    If you have Gen 3 hardware and want to help with development, please reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AffeGaJ5XS).
