## What is the Hosted Service?

The NoLongerEvil hosted service is a **plug-and-play solution** that allows you to liberate your Nest Thermostat from Google's cloud without setting up your own server infrastructure.

<Info>
  **Perfect for beginners!** If you can follow step-by-step instructions and plug in a USB cable, you can successfully set up NoLongerEvil.
</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Flash Firmware">
    Download the firmware installer app and flash custom firmware to your Nest Gen 2 thermostat via USB.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Firmware Redirects Traffic">
    The firmware modifies the network layer to redirect all traffic from Google servers to `backdoor.nolongerevil.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Register a free account at [nolongerevil.com](https://nolongerevil.com) to manage your devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Device">
    Use a 7-character entry code from your thermostat to link it to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Controlling">
    Access your thermostat through the web dashboard from anywhere in the world!
  </Step>
</Steps>
