## Overview

You can link multiple Nest thermostats to a single NoLongerEvil account. This is perfect for:

- Multi-zone homes with multiple thermostats
- Managing thermostats in different properties
- Testing devices before deploying to production

## Prerequisites

Before claiming an additional device:

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Device has NoLongerEvil firmware installed ([see installation guide](/hosted/installation))
  - [ ] Device is connected to WiFi
  - [ ] You're logged into your NoLongerEvil account
</Checklist>

## How to Claim a Device

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Entry Code">
    On the Nest thermostat you want to link:

    1. Navigate to **Settings → Nest App → Get Entry Code**
    2. A 7-character code will appear (e.g., `K2P9WXL`)
    3. Note the code (it expires in 1 hour)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Dashboard">
    Go to [nolongerevil.com](https://nolongerevil.com) and log in to your account.

    You can now control it from the dashboard!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Entry Code Details

### How Entry Codes Work

Entry codes are temporary 7-character strings that link a device to your account:

- **Generated on-demand** by the thermostat
- **Single-use** - each code can only claim one device
- **Time-limited** - expires after 1 hour (3600 seconds by default)
- **Random** - uses secure random generation
- **Case-sensitive** - must be entered exactly as shown

### Why Entry Codes?

Entry codes provide a secure way to link devices without requiring complex authentication on the thermostat:

1. **User-friendly**: Easy to type and read
2. **Secure**: Short-lived and single-use prevents unauthorized access
3. **Offline-capable**: Can be generated without internet (code validated when connected)
4. **No credentials needed**: Don't need to enter passwords on the thermostat

## Managing Multiple Devices

Once you have multiple devices linked:

### Viewing All Devices

The dashboard shows all your devices in a grid or list view:

- Device name (customizable)
- Current temperature
- Target temperature
- Heating/cooling status
- Last seen timestamp

### Renaming Devices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Device Settings">
    Click the gear icon or settings button on a device card
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Name">
    Enter a friendly name like:
    - "Living Room"
    - "Master Bedroom"
    - "Guest House"
    - "Basement"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click Save - the new name appears everywhere in the dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Devices

To unlink a device from your account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Device Settings">
    Open the device settings menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Device">
    Click **"Remove Device"** or **"Unlink"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the removal

    <Warning>
      The device will continue to function as a local thermostat, but you'll lose remote access until you claim it again.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Entry code says 'Invalid'" icon="xmark">
    **Possible causes:**

    - Code was mistyped (check for 0/O, 1/I/L confusion)
    - Code expired (>1 hour old) - generate a new one
    - Code already used - generate a new one
    - Device not connected to WiFi - check network

    **Solution**: Generate a fresh entry code and try again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Entry code says 'Expired'" icon="clock">
    Entry codes are only valid for 1 hour after generation.

    **Solution**: Generate a new code:
    - Settings → Nest App → Get Entry Code
    - Enter the new code immediately
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Device appears offline immediately after claiming" icon="wifi-slash">
    The device may not be connected to WiFi or can't reach NoLongerEvil servers.

    **Check:**
    - WiFi connection on the thermostat (Settings → Network)
    - Internet connectivity
    - Firewall not blocking port 443

    See [Network Troubleshooting](/hosted/troubleshooting#network-issues)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find 'Get Entry Code' option" icon="question">
    Make sure:
    - NoLongerEvil firmware is installed (see the NoLongerEvil logo on boot)
    - Device has completed first boot
    - You're in Settings → Nest App (not Settings → App)

    If still missing, the firmware may not have flashed correctly. Try reflashing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Info>
  **Physical access required**: To claim a device, someone must have physical access to the thermostat to retrieve the entry code. This prevents remote hijacking of devices.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Don't share entry codes**: Treat entry codes like passwords. Anyone with the code can link the device to their account. If you accidentally share a code, let it expire or claim the device yourself immediately.
</Warning>
