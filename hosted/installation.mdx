## Step 2: Prepare Your Thermostat

Before flashing, prepare your Nest thermostat:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Charge the Battery">
    Ensure your thermostat is charged to **at least 50%**.

    - Check battery level: **Settings → Technical Info → Battery**
    - If low, leave it on the wall mount connected to your HVAC system for 1-2 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your Settings (Optional)">
    While the firmware should preserve your settings, it's good practice to note:

    - Current temperature schedules
    - Auto-Away settings
    - Furnace/AC wiring configuration

    Take photos of your schedule screens if desired.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove from Wall">
    Pull the Nest display off the wall mount/backplate.

    - Hold the display and gently pull straight out
    - The device will continue to run on battery power
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Connect Device to Computer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Micro USB Cable">
    Use a **data-capable** micro USB cable (not charging-only).

    <Warning>
      Some cheap USB cables only support charging and won't work for data transfer. If the installer doesn't detect your device, try a different cable.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Plug Into Computer">
    Connect the Nest thermostat to your computer:

    1. Find the micro USB port on the back of the Nest (behind the display)
    2. Plug the micro USB end into the thermostat
    3. Plug the USB end into your computer

    The thermostat screen should turn on if it was off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Installer">
    Open the No Longer Evil firmware installer app you downloaded in Step 1, following the instructions to flash the firmware.

    The app will display "Waiting for device..."
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Enter DFU Mode

DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode allows the firmware to be flashed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure Installer is Running">
    **CRITICAL**: The installer app must be running and showing "Waiting for device..." **BEFORE** you reboot the thermostat.

    Do not proceed until the installer is ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reboot the Thermostat">
    With the USB cable connected:

    1. **Press and hold** the center of the Nest display
    2. Keep holding for **10-15 seconds**
    3. The screen will go black and the device will reboot
    4. **Continue holding** during the reboot
    5. Release when you see the screen flash or the installer recognizes the device
  </Step>

  <Step title="DFU Mode Activated">
    When successful, you'll see:

    - The installer app detects the device and begins the flashing process
    - The Nest screen may be blank or show a No Longer Evil boot logo

    <Tip>
      **If it doesn't work the first time**: Re-attach the device to the back plate, boot the device, and then remove from the back plate and try again.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 5: Flash Firmware

Once the device is in DFU mode, the installer will automatically begin flashing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Flashing Begins">
    The installer will flash three components in sequence:

    1. **x-load.bin** - First-stage bootloader (~ 5 seconds)
    2. **u-boot.bin** - Second-stage bootloader (~10 seconds)
    3. **uImage** - Linux kernel (~30-60 seconds)

    You'll see a progress bar for each component.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Do Not Disconnect">
    <Warning>
      **DO NOT unplug the device** during flashing! This can brick your thermostat.
    </Warning>

    Keep the USB cable connected and wait for the "Flashing complete!" message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Flashing Complete">
    When done, the installer will show:

    ✅ **"Firmware flashing successful!"**

    The device will automatically reboot.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Register Account

Now that your thermostat has the No Longer Evil firmware, let's set up your account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit nolongerevil.com">
    Open [https://nolongerevil.com](https://nolongerevil.com) in your web browser.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Account">
    Click **"Sign Up"** and register using:

    - Email and password
    - Or social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)

    You'll receive a verification email (check spam folder if needed).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Email">
    Click the verification link in your email to activate your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Dashboard">
    Once verified, log in and you'll see your **Dashboard**.

    Since you haven't linked any devices yet, you'll see:

    **"No devices found"** with a prompt to enter an entry code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 7: Link Your Device

The final step is linking your thermostat to your NoLongerEvil account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Thermostat to WiFi">
    Before linking, ensure your thermostat is connected to WiFi:

    1. On the thermostat, go to **Settings → Network**
    2. Select your WiFi network and enter the password
    3. Wait for it to connect (you'll see a WiFi icon on the display)

    <Note>
      The thermostat needs internet access to communicate with No Longer Evil servers.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Entry Code from Thermostat">
    On your Nest device, navigate to:

    **Settings → Nest App → Get Entry Code**

    The device will display a **7-character entry code** (e.g., `A3XR7M2`).

    <Warning>
      **Entry codes expire after 1 hour.** If it expires, simply generate a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Code in Dashboard">
    On the No Longer Evil dashboard:

    1. Find the "Link Device" or "Enter Entry Code" input field
    2. Type the 7-character code exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
    3. Click **"Link Device"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Device Linked!">
    If successful, your thermostat will appear in the dashboard with its:

    - Serial number
    - Current temperature
    - Heating/cooling status
    - Last seen timestamp
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 8: Verify Everything Works

Let's make sure your thermostat is fully operational:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Dashboard Connection">
    In the dashboard, verify you can see:

    - ✅ Current temperature updating in real-time
    - ✅ Schedules
    - ✅ Heating/cooling status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Temperature Control">
    Try changing the temperature:

    1. In the dashboard, adjust the target temperature
    2. Watch the thermostat screen update
    3. Verify the HVAC system responds (heat/cool turns on)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reinstall on Wall">
    Once everything is working:

    1. Align the Nest with the backplate on the wall
    2. Push gently until it clicks into place
    3. The device will reconnect to HVAC power and charge
  </Step>
</Steps>
