## DFU Mode Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Device won't enter DFU mode" icon="usb">
    **Symptoms**: Holding display doesn't trigger installer detection

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Charge the battery**: DFU mode requires sufficient power (>50%)
       - Check: Settings → Technical Info → Battery
       - Charge on wall mount for 1-2 hours if low

    2. **Try a different hold duration**:
       - Some devices need 10 seconds, others 15
       - Try holding for 20 seconds to be safe

    3. **Ensure installer is running FIRST**:
       - Start the installer app BEFORE rebooting
       - Wait for "Waiting for device..." message

    4. **Try a different USB cable**:
       - Some cables are charging-only (no data pins)
       - Use a cable that works for file transfer

    5. **Try a different USB port**:
       - Some ports don't provide enough power
       - Try a USB 2.0 port instead of USB 3.0
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Device reboots but installer doesn't detect it" icon="computer">
    **Symptoms**: Thermostat reboots but installer still says "Waiting..."

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check USB drivers** (Windows):

       - Look for "OMAP" or unknown devices
       - Install OMAP drivers if needed

    2. **Grant USB permissions** (macOS):
       - System Preferences → Security & Privacy
       - Allow NoLongerEvil app USB access

    3. **Run with sudo** (Linux):
       ```bash
       sudo ./NoLongerEvil.AppImage
       ```

    4. **Add udev rules** (Linux):
       ```bash
       echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0451", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-omap.rules
       sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
       ```

    5. **Try a different computer**:
       - Some computers have USB compatibility issues
       - Try a different OS if possible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple DFU attempts fail" icon="rotate">
    **Symptoms**: Device enters DFU but flashing fails repeatedly

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Let device fully boot first**:
       - After failed attempt, let device boot completely
       - Wait 5 minutes
       - Try DFU mode again

    2. **Check USB connection stability**:
       - Wiggle cable to check for loose connection

## Device Detection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installer says 'Device not found'" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Check these in order**:

    1. **USB cable is data-capable**
       - Test cable with phone file transfer
       - If phone only charges, cable is power-only

    2. **Device is actually in DFU mode**
       - Screen should be blank or flickering
       - Normal boot screen means DFU wasn't entered

    3. **USB port has power**
       - Try different ports
       - Desktop back panel ports often more reliable than front

    4. **OS permissions**:
       - **macOS**: Security & Privacy → allow USB
